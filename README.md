# Introduction
  This is our Machine learning project "Credit Card Approval".  
  We used two different models, Logistic Regression and XGBoost Classifier.

# To Run
  In order to run the code you will need
    -numpy  
    -pandas  
    -sklearn  
    -xgboost  
    -matplot (if you want to see the feature importance chart)  

  This code can be run normally through the console with 'python LogisticRegressionModel.py'
